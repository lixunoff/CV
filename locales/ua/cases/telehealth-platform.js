  ## Overview
  
  The veterinary clinic app was designed to address key pain points in pet healthcare management:

  2. **Pet Health Records** - Secure access to vaccination history, medications, and visit notes
  3. **Medication Reminders** - Push notifications for medication schedules
  4. **Direct Messaging** - HIPAA-compliant chat with veterinary staff
  
  ## Results
  
  The app led to:
